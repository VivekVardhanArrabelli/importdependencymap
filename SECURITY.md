# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Build for India safe. If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not create a public issue.** Email `security@buildforindia.dev` with a detailed report.
2. Include reproduction steps, affected endpoints, and any logs or payloads that help us triage quickly.
3. Allow 5 business days for an initial response. We will coordinate embargo and disclosure timelines with you.
4. Please avoid automated scans against production deployments without prior written consent.

We treat security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. Public acknowledgement is available on request once a fix has shipped.
