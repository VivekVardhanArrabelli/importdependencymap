# Code of Conduct

We are committed to building a respectful, inclusive community. All contributors and maintainers are expected to:

- Treat everyone with respect. Harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks are not tolerated.
- Assume positive intent, give constructive feedback, and avoid hostile language.
- Keep discussions, reviews, and issues focused on the work at hand.
- Respect privacy. Do not disclose personal or sensitive information without permission.
- Report unacceptable behaviour to the maintainers at `security@buildforindia.dev`.

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning offenders or removing access, to keep the project healthy. By participating in this project you agree to uphold this Code of Conduct.
